# What is this
These few scripts fetch the covid-19 data from germany once a day and generate a HTML page that shows a more or less nice graph. It's designed to be placed on a webserver somewhere, but you can put it on your local disk - it will run just as smooth. Because the source git repo is cloned completely you'll need some space, as of 01/2021 a little less than two gigabytes.
