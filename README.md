# What is this?
These few scripts fetch the covid-19 infection data for germany and generate a HTML page that shows a more or less nice graph. It's designed to be placed on a webserver somewhere, but you can put it on your local disk - it will run just as smooth.

# Execute
Just run processdata.sh shellscript.

# Create a cronjob
You can run the create-cronjob.sh shellscript to create a cronjob.

# See it in action
